links.net

modern info overload is like info scarcity or scarcity of links in the past
now it's all muddy and full of shit so clean quality links is like a cleansing pipeline of enlightnment

those that inspired me to get started

fight perfectionism

don't take yourself too seriously

talk about notes, information diet, we are what we eat like we are what we read or goes through our brain literally

talk about pocket, then omnivore

talk about design of a notes interface to (a) encourage people reading my notes rather than going away from my site and (b) encourage users to access more of my notes by having them under collapsible sections.
