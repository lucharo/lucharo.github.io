# My Space

This repo is for my home space on the internet (https://luischav.es). I have
left the "legacy" name of lucharo.github.io as it was previously hosted as
GitHub Pages even though I currently deploy it through Cloudflare pages and
have disabled the Pages feature in GitHub. I have also set up some projects
GitHub Pages that were hosted under my main GH pages domain as subdomains, e.g:

- [cook.luischav.es](https://cook.luischav.es) <- used to be
  luischav.es/recipe-portfolio aka lucharo.github.io/recipe-portfolio (repo at
  [lucharo/recipe-portfolio](https://github.com/lucharo/recipe-portfolio))
- [luischav.es](https://luischav.es) <- used to be lucharo.github.io
